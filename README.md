# 🚀 Kvatch CLI

**Kvatch CLI** lets you query multiple data sources — databases, files, APIs (coming soon) — as if they were a single SQL database.  
Run it **locally for free**, or sign up for early access to the upcoming **remote mode** for multi-user collaboration and orchestration.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Query anything with SQL** — SV, JSON, SQLite, Postgres, APIs (coming soon) and more
- 🧱 **Plan-based architecture** — Define everything in one YAML or JSON file
- 💻 **Local mode (Free)** — All processing happens locally, no cloud required
- 🌐 **Remote mode (Coming Soon)** — Share, schedule, and orchestrate data jobs
- ⚙️ **Simple CLI** — One binary, zero dependencies

## 🧪 Getting started

The easiest way to get started is by running a built-in example, see the [examples](./examples) directory for ready-to-run plans:

- Basic CSV / JSON ingestion
- SQLite and Postgres queries
- Deduplication and joins across sources
- Enterprise-grade federation scenarios

---

## 🧩 How It Works

Kvatch uses a single `plan.yaml` or `plan.json` file to:

- Define **data sources** (CSV, SQLite, Postgres, etc.)
- Configure **datasets** with SQL queries and plugins
- Enable **joins**, **deduplication**, and **storage options**
